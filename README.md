# Analyze A/B Test Results



This project is a part of [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). 



### Project Overview 


For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.
My goal was to help the company understand if they should implement the new
page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.




### Getting Started 


You'll need to install :

* Python

* Pandas
* Numpy 

* Matplotlib
